# Polopoly Importer Plugin for IntelliJ

Based on Marc Viane's work <https://github.com/mavicon/intellij-ppimport> and inspiration
from Johan Rylander's Atex Polopoly plugin for IntelliJ <https://github.com/jrylander/PolopolyIntelliJPlugin>.

This plugin is written to simplify import of content XML files into the Polopoly CMS.

## Key features

* import a single file or import multiple file selections
* import not only from the editor, but also from Project Tool window and the Changes Tool window
* multiple files can be imported in bulk (as a jar) (specific Polopoly functionality)
* specify multiple targets (e.g. local, dev, staging and production) directly accessible from the context menu
* specify file extensions to import
* protect against accidental imports by asking for a confirmation (per target configurable)
* search and replace specific strings in the content before importing

This plugin stores the configuration at the IntelliJ application level, so they are available in all IntelliJ projects.
This is different from Johan or Marc's plugin, which store this information separately for each project.
